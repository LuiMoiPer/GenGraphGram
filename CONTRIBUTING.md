At the time of writing I am not fammilar with contributiond guidelines, so I have to look into that.

Sections to add:
* Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
* Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
* Community and behavioral expectations.

Example contribution guidelines:
* https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
* https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
